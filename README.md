# percent-clock
A simple clock that displays time in percentages relative to the duration between 9am and 6pm.

## How do I adjust the times?
[These values are hard-coded](./lib/clock.cpp#L10-11) for now. 

## Why?

Often we struggle with work-life balance. As Americans, we work a lot (we do the most).
Our struggle is not with more productivity, but with maintaining a sustainable work environment.
The solution for many (include those not so successful) is to produce the minimal work.
While this somewhat solves the issue of work overload, it can potentially lead to destructive procrastination (vs productive procrastination)
This clocks aims to help solve this issue of maintaining a balance.
Rather than simply telling you the time, this clock conveys the time in percentage allow you to ask yourself the question:
*"Okay. I've wasted 33% percent of my day. What do I have to show for it?"*
